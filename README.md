Link of Datasets are : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mLvbig9SHP_EzxmRMwT_7xC8wQl5bK_I?usp=sharing
For make this project run in your local system you have to install XAMP first and create a database capstone as database name district as table names given above of the drive folder (Note : Name spelling should be same)
and save this 2 file i.e. Home_Page and Predictor_Page as follow : (c >> xampp >> htdocs >> PHP >> capstone >> Home_Page and Predictor_Page)
More details will be uploaded in Report and Presentation.
